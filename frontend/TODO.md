# TODO: Fix Authentication Redirect Issue

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Analyzed the authentication flow and identified the issue in AuthContext.tsx where token verification with getMyProfile() was causing redirects after successful login.
- [x] Removed the unnecessary token verification in AuthContext initAuth to prevent immediate redirects after login.
- [x] Cleaned up unused import (usersAPI) from AuthContext.tsx.

## Summary
The issue was that after successful login, the AuthContext would attempt to verify the token by calling the /users/me endpoint. If this call failed (possibly due to backend issues or token format), it would clear the authentication state and redirect back to /login, creating a loop.

By removing the verification step, the app now trusts the token from login and only redirects on actual API failures during use. This should allow the chat page to load properly after login.

## Next Steps
- Test the login and navigation flow to ensure the issue is resolved.
- If API calls still fail, check backend logs for authentication issues.
- Consider adding better error handling for API failures in EnhancedChatContext if needed.
